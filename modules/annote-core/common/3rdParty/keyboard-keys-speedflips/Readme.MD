Do you need keys from a keyboard as SVG and PNG graphics? Here you go, I created a full set of keys (blank and bordered) in 200 dpi, 300 dpi and 400 dpi resolutions. In other words, you get many different sizes that will suit your needs. You also find a complete keyboard as SVG and PNG in different versions included. And the best thing: Everything is for free, public domain :)

### Note

I am using the keys for all screencast videos I am doing for speedflips com and overlay my tutorial videos with these shortcut graphics. Check out [one of the videos](https://www.youtube.com/user/speedflips) to get an idea.

For my screencasts in size 1280 x 720, I am using the **300 dpi versions**.

If you have any suggestions for improving the graphics, comment in the github repo.

Have fun and do good! ~~ Kai
